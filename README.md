# Maximum Substring Value Finder

This Java program finds the maximum value of a substring within a given string. It calculates the value of each substring based on the frequency of its occurrences in the string multiplied by its length.

## Features

- **Substring Value Calculation**: Calculates the value of each substring based on its length and frequency of occurrences within the string.
- **Input Handling**: Utilizes the `Scanner` class for user input, ensuring flexibility in input string.
- **Algorithm**:
    - Iterates through each character in the input string.
    - Calculates the frequency of each substring and its length.
    - Determines the maximum value of substrings encountered.

## Usage

To use the program, compile the `Main.java` file and execute the generated class file. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the string, and the program will output the maximum substring value.

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
